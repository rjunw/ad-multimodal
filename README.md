# Multimodal analysis of genetic contributions on image data 

Multi-modal learning for Alzheimer's and self-supervised contrastive learning with simulated image-gene modalities. Due to lack of data access, we simulate genetic data paired to [2D MRI Imaging](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) data in order to verify [Taleb et. al (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13424)'s methodology.

We also do a tabular data analysis with genetic, demographic, and clinical data.

To reproduce, download the linked data, or retrieve Luria cluster access with UK Biobank approval, and then run the provided notebooks. For the `contrastive_genesim.ipynb` notebook, switch the file directories. Otherwise, simply use the provided source code and functions in the same manner as the notebook.
