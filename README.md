# Multimodal analysis of genetic contributions on image data 

Multi-modal learning for Alzheimer's and self-supervised contrastive learning with simulated image-gene modalities. Due to lack of data access, we simulate genetic data paired to ![2D MRI Imaging](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) data in order to verify ![Taleb et. al (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13424)'s methodology.

We also do a tabular data analysis with genetic, demographic, and clinical data.
